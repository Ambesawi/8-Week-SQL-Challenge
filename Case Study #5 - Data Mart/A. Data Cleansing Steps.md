## ðŸ§¼ Solution - A. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:  

| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

## Data Exploration

Ok, before I begin with the solution, I'm running some queries to get a feel of the data.

````sql
SELECT *
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
LIMIT 5
````

````sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
````

There are total of 17,117 rows.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT region
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
````

There are 2 `platform`s - Shopify and Retail.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT segment
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
ORDER BY segment
````

There are 8 unique `segment`s.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_type
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
````

There are 3 types of `customer_type`.

## Create New Table `clean_weekly_sales`

Here, we construct the structure of `clean_weekly_sales` table and lay out the actions to be taken.

_`*` represent new columns_

| Columns | Actions to take |
| ------- | --------------- |
| week_date | Convert to `DATE`
| week_number* | Add number of week  
| month_number* | Extract month from `week_date`
| calendar_year* | Extract year from `week_date`
| region | No changes
| platform | No changes
| segment | No changes
| age_band* | Based on `segment`, 1 = `Young Adults`, 2 = `Middle Aged` and 3 or 4 = `Retirees` 
| demographic* | Based on `segment`, C = `Couples` and F = `Families`, null = `unknown`
| transactions | No changes
| avg_transaction* | Divide `sales` with `transactions` and round up to 2 decimal places
| sales | No changes

**Answer:**

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;
CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS (
SELECT
  TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY') AS week_date,
  DATE_PART('week', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS week_number,
  DATE_PART('month', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS month_number,
  DATE_PART('year', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS calendar_year,
  region, 
  platform, 
  segment,
  CASE WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) in ('3','4') THEN 'Retirees'
    ELSE 'unknown' END AS age_band,
  CASE WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples'
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'F' THEN 'Families'
    ELSE 'unknown' END AS demographic,
  transactions,
  ROUND((sales::NUMERIC/transactions),2) AS avg_transaction,
  sales
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales);
