## Business Task
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs **banking activities** and also acts as the world‚Äôs most secure distributed **data storage platform**!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. 

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

**Table 1: `regions`**

This regions table contains the `region_id` and their respective `region_name` values.

**Table 2: `customer_nodes`**

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region. This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!

***

**4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?**

````sql
WITH node_days AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    node_id,
    end_date - start_date AS days_in_node
  FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
  WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date
) 
, total_node_days AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    node_id,
    SUM(days_in_node) AS total_days_in_node
  FROM node_days
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_days_in_node)) AS avg_node_reallocation_days
FROM total_node_days;
````

**Answer:**

|avg_node_reallocation_days|
|:----|
|24|

- On average, customers are reallocated to a different node every 24 days.

***

**5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?**



***

## üè¶ B. Customer Transactions

**1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?**

````sql
SELECT
  txn_type, 
  COUNT(customer_id) AS transaction_count, 
  SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amount
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type;
````

**Answer:**

|txn_type|transaction_count|total_amount|
|:----|:----|:----|
|purchase|1617|806537|
|deposit|2671|1359168|
|withdrawal|1580|793003|

***

**2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?**

````sql
WITH deposits AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    COUNT(customer_id) AS txn_count, 
    AVG(txn_amount) AS avg_amount
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
  WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
  GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(txn_count)) AS avg_deposit_count, 
  ROUND(AVG(avg_amount)) AS avg_deposit_amt
FROM deposits;
````
**Answer:**

|avg_deposit_count|avg_deposit_amt|
|:----|:----|
|5|509|

- The average historical deposit count is 5 and the average historical deposit amount is $ 509.

***

**3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?**

First, create a CTE called `monthly_transactions` to determine the count of deposit, purchase and withdrawal for each customer categorised by month using `CASE` statement and `SUM()`. 

In the main query, select the `mth` column and count the number of unique customers where:
- `deposit_count` is greater than 1, indicating more than one deposit (`deposit_count > 1`).
- Either `purchase_count` is greater than or equal to 1 (`purchase_count >= 1`) OR `withdrawal_count` is greater than or equal to 1 (`withdrawal_count >= 1`).

````sql
WITH monthly_transactions AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    DATE_PART('month', txn_date) AS mth,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS deposit_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS purchase_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS withdrawal_count
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
  GROUP BY customer_id, DATE_PART('month', txn_date)
)

SELECT
  mth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM monthly_transactions
WHERE deposit_count > 1 
  AND (purchase_count >= 1 OR withdrawal_count >= 1)
GROUP BY mth
ORDER BY mth;
````

**Answer:**

|month|customer_count|
|:----|:----|
|1|170|
|2|277|
|3|292|
|4|103|

***

**4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month? Also show the change in balance each month in the same table output.**

Update Jun 2, 2023: Even after 2 years, I continue to find this question incredibly challenging. I have cleaned up the code and provided additional explanations. 

The key aspect to understanding the solution is to run the CTEs cumulatively. This approach allows for a better understanding of why specific columns were created or certain window functions were applied.

````sql
-- CTE 1 - To identify transaction amount as an inflow (+) or outflow (-)
WITH monthly_balances_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    (DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date) + INTERVAL '1 MONTH - 1 DAY') AS closing_month, 
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' OR txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
      ELSE txn_amount END) AS transaction_balance
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
  GROUP BY 
    customer_id, txn_date 
)

-- CTE 2 - Use GENERATE_SERIES() to generate as a series of last day of the month for each customer.
, monthend_series_cte AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT customer_id,
    ('2020-01-31'::DATE + GENERATE_SERIES(0,3) * INTERVAL '1 MONTH') AS ending_month
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
)

-- CTE 3 - Calculate total monthly change and ending balance for each month using window function SUM()
, monthly_changes_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    monthend_series_cte.customer_id, 
    monthend_series_cte.ending_month,
    SUM(monthly_balances_cte.transaction_balance) OVER (
      PARTITION BY monthend_series_cte.customer_id, monthend_series_cte.ending_month
      ORDER BY monthend_series_cte.ending_month
    ) AS total_monthly_change,
    SUM(monthly_balances_cte.transaction_balance) OVER (
      PARTITION BY monthend_series_cte.customer_id 
      ORDER BY monthend_series_cte.ending_month
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS ending_balance
  FROM monthend_series_cte
  LEFT JOIN monthly_balances_cte
    ON monthend_series_cte.ending_month = monthly_balances_cte.closing_month
    AND monthend_series_cte.customer_id = monthly_balances_cte.customer_id
)

 SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  ending_month, 
  COALESCE(total_monthly_change, 0) AS total_monthly_change, 
  MIN(ending_balance) AS ending_balance
 FROM monthly_changes_cte
 GROUP BY 
  customer_id, ending_month, total_monthly_change
 ORDER BY 
  customer_id, ending_month;
````

**Answer:**

Sample for customers ID 1, 2 and 3:
|customer_id|ending_month|total_monthly_change|ending_balance|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1|2020-01-31T00:00:00.000Z|312|312|
|1|2020-02-29T00:00:00.000Z|0|312|

**5. Comparing the closing balance of a customer‚Äôs first month and the closing balance from their second nth, what percentage of customers:**

For this question, I created 2 temp tables
  - Create `temp table #1` from Q4's solution. All you have to do is copy + paste the Q4 syntax and create a temp table.
  - Then, using temp table #1, create `temp table #2` by running a `ROW_NUMBER` function to rank records for individual customer.

```sql
-- Temp table #1: Create a temp table using Q4 solution
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_monthly_balances AS (
  WITH monthly_balances_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    (DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date) + INTERVAL '1 MONTH - 1 DAY') AS closing_month, 
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' OR txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
      ELSE txn_amount END) AS transaction_balance
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
  GROUP BY 
    customer_id, txn_date 
), monthend_series_cte AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT customer_id,
    ('2020-01-31'::DATE + GENERATE_SERIES(0,3) * INTERVAL '1 MONTH') AS ending_month
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
), monthly_changes_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    monthend_series_cte.customer_id, 
    monthend_series_cte.ending_month,
    SUM(monthly_balances_cte.transaction_balance) OVER (
      PARTITION BY monthend_series_cte.customer_id, monthend_series_cte.ending_month
      ORDER BY monthend_series_cte.ending_month
    ) AS total_monthly_change,
    SUM(monthly_balances_cte.transaction_balance) OVER (
      PARTITION BY monthend_series_cte.customer_id 
      ORDER BY monthend_series_cte.ending_month
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS ending_balance
  FROM monthend_series_cte
  LEFT JOIN monthly_balances_cte
    ON monthend_series_cte.ending_month = monthly_balances_cte.closing_month
    AND monthend_series_cte.customer_id = monthly_balances_cte.customer_id 
)

 SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  ending_month, 
  COALESCE(total_monthly_change, 0) AS total_monthly_change, 
  MIN(ending_balance) AS ending_balance
 FROM monthly_changes_cte
 GROUP BY 
  customer_id, ending_month, total_monthly_change
 ORDER BY 
  customer_id, ending_month;
);

-- Temp table #2: Create a temp table using temp table #1 `customer_monthly_balances`
CREATE TEMP TABLE ranked_monthly_balances AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    ending_month, 
    ending_balance,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id 
      ORDER BY ending_month) AS sequence
  FROM customer_monthly_balances
);
```

**- What percentage of customers have a negative first month balance?**
**- What percentage of customers have a positive first month balance?**

````sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN ending_balance::TEXT LIKE '-%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
    /(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer_monthly_balances),1) AS negative_first_month_percentage,
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN ending_balance::TEXT NOT LIKE '-%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  /(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer_monthly_balances),1) AS positive_first_month_percentage
FROM ranked_monthly_balances
WHERE ranked_row = 1;
````

A cheeky solution would be to simply calculate one of the percentage and deducting from 100%.
```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    COUNT(customer_id)
    /(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer_monthly_balances)
  ,1) AS negative_first_month_percentage,
  100 - ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(customer_id)
    /(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer_monthly_balances)
    ,1) AS positive_first_month_percentage
FROM ranked_monthly_balances
WHERE ranked_row = 1
	AND ending_balance::TEXT LIKE '-%';
```

**Answer:**

|negative_first_month_percentage|positive_first_month_percentage|
|:----|:----|
|44.8|55.2|

**- What percentage of customers increase their opening month‚Äôs positive closing balance by more than 5% in the following month?**

- Use `LEAD()` function to query the following month's balances and, then filter to select records with 1st month and 2nd month balances only. 
- Also, filter for `next_balance` with positive balances only. 
- We must exclude negative balances from the results because a higher negative balance in the following month does not represent an increase in balances and could mispresent our answer as the percentage of variance would still result in a positive percentage. 

````sql
WITH next_balance_cte AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id, ending_month, closing_balance, 
    LEAD(closing_balance) OVER 
      (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY ending_month) AS next_balance
  FROM q5_sequence

  SELECT 
    customer_id, ending_month,
