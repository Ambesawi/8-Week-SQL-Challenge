## Important Note Regarding My Solutions

Hello fellow learners,

I wanted to address a concerning issue. It has come to my attention that some of the SQL case study solutions on this repository have been copied without proper attribution or permission. I want to emphasize that this behavior goes against the principles of academic integrity and intellectual honesty.

I have put significant effort into developing these solutions, dedicating time and problem-solving skills to create original work. I kindly request that you refrain from copying them verbatim. Instead, I encourage you to use them as a reference and learn from the concepts behind the solutions, applying them in your own unique way.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to support your learning journey and provide guidance.

Thank you for your understanding and for being a part of this community.
