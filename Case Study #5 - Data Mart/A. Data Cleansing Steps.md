## ðŸ§¼ Solution - A. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:  

| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
- Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

### Data Exploration

Ok, before I begin with the solution, I run some syntax to explore and get a feel of the data.

````sql
SELECT *
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
LIMIT 5
````

````sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
````

There are total of 17,117 rows.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT region
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
````

There are 7 `region`s.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT segment
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
ORDER BY segment
````

There are 8 unique `segment`s.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_type
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales

There are 3 types of `customer_type`.
