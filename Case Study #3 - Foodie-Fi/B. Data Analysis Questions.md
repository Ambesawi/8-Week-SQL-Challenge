  TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month') AS month_name, -- Cast to month in month's name
  COUNT(*) AS trial_subscriptions
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
  ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id

  p.plan_name,
  COUNT(*) AS events
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
  ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id

### 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS churn_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions),1) AS churn_percentage
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
  ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.plan_id = 4;
````

**Answer:**

- There are 307 customers who have churned, which is 30.7% of Foodie-Fi customer base.

### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

````sql
WITH ranking AS (
SELECT 
  s.customer_id, 
  s.plan_id, 
  p.plan_name,
  -- Run a ROW_NUMBER() to rank the plans from 0 to 4
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
    ORDER BY s.plan_id) AS plan_rank 
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
  ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id)
  
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS churn_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) / (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions),0) AS churn_percentage
FROM ranking
WHERE plan_id = 4 -- Filter to churn plan
  AND plan_rank = 2 -- Filter to rank 2 as customers who churned immediately after trial have churn plan ranked as 2
````

**Answer:**

  customer_id, 
  plan_id, 
  LEAD(plan_id, 1) OVER(
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY plan_id) as next_plan
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)

SELECT 
  next_plan, 
  COUNT(*) AS conversions,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions),1) AS conversion_percentage
FROM next_plan_cte
WHERE next_plan IS NOT NULL 
  AND plan_id = 0
GROUP BY next_plan
ORDER BY next_plan;
````
